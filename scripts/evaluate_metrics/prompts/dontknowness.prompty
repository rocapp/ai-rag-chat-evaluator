You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.

user:
The "I don't know"-ness metric is a measure of how much an answer conveys the lack of knowledge or uncertainty, which is useful for making sure a chatbot for a particular domain doesn't answer outside that domain. Score the I-dont-know-ness of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:
One star: the answer completely answers the question and conveys no uncertainty
Two stars: the answer conveys a little uncertainty but mostly attempts to answer the question
Three stars: the answer conveys some uncertainty but still contains some attempt to answer the question
Four stars: the answer conveys uncertainty and makes no attempt to answer the question
Five stars: the answer says straightforwardly that it doesn't know, and makes no attempt to answer the question.

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
