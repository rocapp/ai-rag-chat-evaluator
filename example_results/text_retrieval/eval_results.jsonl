When you receive care, you will receive a bill that outlines the cost of the service and the amount you are responsible for paying. If you have met all of your deductibles and coinsurance requirements, the plan will pay the remaining costs. Tips for Using Your Coinsurance: 1. Review your plan documents to understand the coinsurance rates for all services you may need. This will help you budget for any services you may need in the future and be better prepared for the cost. 2. Consider using in-network providers when possible. Many plans offer lower coinsurance rates for in-network providers, meaning you will pay less for the same service.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=13:  Coinsurance IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance Coinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your deductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. Forexample, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the service you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%. Under Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some exceptions. For in-network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. Additionally, coinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%. It's important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by the plan's copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally, Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services. When you receive services, it's important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=48:  Exceptions: Northwind Health Plus does not cover services that are not medically necessary, such as cosmetic surgery, elective treatments, and experimental treatments. In addition, the plan does not cover services for conditions that are not covered by the plan, such as pre-existing conditions.Tips: When selecting a healthcare provider, be sure to choose one that is in-network. This will help you save money by avoiding out-of-network fees. In addition, be sure to ask your doctor or healthcare provider about any copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles that may apply to the services you receive. It is also a good idea to review your plan documents to better understand your coverage and plan benefits.

For example, if the allowed amount for a service is $100 and your coinsurance is 20%, you are responsible for paying $20 (20% of $100). The insurance company will pay the remaining amount of $80.Coinsurance may apply to all services, including hospitalization, emergency room visits, preventive care, and some mental health and substance abuse services.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=13:  For In-Network Services: The calendar year deductible for in-network services is $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families.

Once this amount is reached, the plan will begin to pay its share of the cost of eligible services. For Out-of-Network Services: The plan does not have a calendar year deductible for out-of- network services.
