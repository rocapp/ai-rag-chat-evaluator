Here, we will explain the various costs associated with this plan so that you know what to expect when it comes to your out- of-pocket expenses. Premiums Premiums are the amount of money that you will need to pay each month for your coverage. Northwind Standard requires that premiums be paid on a monthly basis in order to keep the coverage in force. These premiums are based on the age and health of the policy holder, as well as the type of coverage that is chosen. Deductibles A deductible is the amount of money that you will need to pay out of pocket before your insurance plan will begin to cover the costs of your medical services. The deductible for Northwind Standard is $2,000 per person, per year. This means that you will need to pay the first $2,000 of your medical expenses before the plan will \n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=74:  Additionally, Northwind Standard will not pay any expensesthat exceed the limits of the primary plan. For example, if the primary plan has a $1,000 deductible and Northwind Standard has a $500 deductible, only the $500 deductible from the primary plan will be paid. There are some exceptions to the primary and secondary rules. For instance, if you have Medicare coverage, it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and Northwind Standard will be the secondary coverage. However, if you have Medicare Part D for prescription drugs, Northwind Standard will be the primary coverage and Medicare Part D will be the secondary coverage. It's also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage, you may need to provide evidence of that coverage to your health plan. This is known as \"creditable coverage,\" and it helps to ensure that Northwind Standard will pay any eligible expenses once the primary plan has paid. When it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules, it's important to remember that each health plan is different.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=74:  If you have other health coverage, such as coverage through a spouse's plan, Northwind Standard may become your secondary coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will pay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays. The primary and secondary rules that apply to Northwind Standard are important to understand. When you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and the secondary plan pays second. The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying the largest portion of your healthcare costs. For example, if you have a spouse's health plan and Northwind Standard, your spouse's plan would be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan. This means that your spouse's plan would pay for the majority of your healthcare costs and Northwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs. It's important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not covered by the primary plan. Additionally, Northwind Standard will not pay any expensesthat exceed the limits of the primary plan.","truth":"When you are enrolled in Northwind Standard, your plan will cover a portion of your medical and vision expenses.\n[Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details-91.pdf]","gpt_groundedness":5,"gpt_coherence":5,"gpt_fluency":5,"gpt_similarity":1,"gpt_relevance":5}

Could you please provide more specific details or clarify your question?","context":"Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=74:  If you have other health coverage, such as coverage through a spouse's plan, Northwind Standard may become your secondary coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will pay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays. The primary and secondary rules that apply to Northwind Standard are important to understand. When you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and the secondary plan pays second. The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying the largest portion of your healthcare costs. For example, if you have a spouse's health plan and Northwind Standard, your spouse's plan would be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan. This means that your spouse's plan would pay for the majority of your healthcare costs and Northwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs. It's important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not covered by the primary plan. Additionally, Northwind Standard will not pay any expensesthat exceed the limits of the primary plan.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=75:  When it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules, it's important to remember that each health plan is different. Be sure to review your plan documents to understand the specific rules and restrictions that apply to your coverage. Finally, if you have any questions or concerns about your coverage, be sure to reach out to Northwind Health. Their knowledgeable customer service representatives are always available to answer your questions and provide guidance on how best to use your coverage. COB's Effect On Benefits WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE? When you have other health insurance coverage, coordination of benefits (COB) can affect how your benefits are paid. COB is a process where your insurance companies coordinate who pays first when you have multiple health insurance plans that cover the same medical expenses.
