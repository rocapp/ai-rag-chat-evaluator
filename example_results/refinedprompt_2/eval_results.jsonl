This means that Northwind Standard will pay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays. The primary and secondary rules that apply to Northwind Standard are important to understand. When you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and the secondary plan pays second. The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying the largest portion of your healthcare costs. For example, if you have a spouse's health plan and Northwind Standard, your spouse's plan would be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan. This means that your spouse's plan would pay for the majority of your healthcare costs and Northwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs.

Additionally, Northwind Standard will not pay any expensesthat exceed the limits of the primary plan.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=75:  When it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules, it's important to remember that each health plan is different.
