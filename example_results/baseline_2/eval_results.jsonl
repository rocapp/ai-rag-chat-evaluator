However, coinsurance does not apply to preventive care services [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=14].","context":"Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=14: Coinsurance may apply to all services, including hospitalization, emergency room visits, preventive care, and some mental health and substance abuse services. However, coinsurance does not apply to some services, such as preventive care services. It is important to understand the amount of coinsurance you are responsible for. Depending on the type of service, your coinsurance could be a percentage of the allowed amount or a fixed amount. This information should be provided to you in your plan documents. When you receive care, you will receive a bill that outlines the cost of the service and the amount you are responsible for paying. If you have met all of your deductibles and coinsurance requirements, the plan will pay the remaining costs. Tips for Using Your Coinsurance: 1. Review your plan documents to understand the coinsurance rates for all services you may need. This will help you budget for any services you may need in the future and be better prepared for the cost. 2. Consider using in-network providers when possible. Many plans offer lower coinsurance rates for in-network providers, meaning you will pay less for the same service.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=13:  Coinsurance IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance Coinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your deductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. Forexample, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the service you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%. Under Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some exceptions. For in-network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. Additionally, coinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%. It's important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by the plan's copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally, Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services. When you receive services, it's important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=14:  When you receive services, it's important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs. It's also important to be aware of the coinsurance rate for out-of-network services and to consider if it's worth the cost to pay more for out-of- network services. It's also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed amount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what is allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the actual cost. If you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard will allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment. Finally, it's important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your out-of- pocket maximum faster, thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket for services.","latency":1.840215,"has_citation":true,"answer_length":274,"gpt_coherence":5,"gpt_relevance":4,"gpt_groundedness":5}

The insurance company will pay the remaining amount of $80.Coinsurance may apply to all services, including hospitalization, emergency room visits, preventive care, and some mental health and substance abuse services.","latency":2.734175,"has_citation":true,"answer_length":755,"gpt_coherence":5,"gpt_relevance":5,"gpt_groundedness":5}
